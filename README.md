# BlendTools
These tools are developed to help with blender projects I may be involved with in the future. Primarily Python scripting for Blender at this point.

## font-screener.py
This file will iterate through a font repository and filter the fonts within into new repos labelled "safe" or "error"

Currently this script is only used to filter a rare and hard to detect Scale to Fit bug

This script is now obsolete, instead set the vertical height of your text box to 0.001 to enforce a one line evaluation
